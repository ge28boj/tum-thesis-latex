\section{Motivation}

TinyML has obtained more attentions in academy as well as in industries recently. There is huge potential to revolutionize the world when hundreds of billions of embedded devices are able to
run machine learning applications offline. Nevertheless, given the resource-constrained nature of embedded devices, it still remains a challenge to codesign hardware and software.

\noindent RISC-V is promising in TinyML applications. For one thing, traditional x86 architecture is not power efficient enough compared to RISC-based architecture.
For another, Arm-based processors require licensing fees since they are vendor-specific, whereas RISC-V ISA is open-source.
The TUM EDA chair has developed the RISC-V instruction set simulator ETISS, which features the plug-in functionalities and supports rapid development of customized ISA based on user needs.

\noindent This thesis aims to provide a methodology of profiling TinyML applications in ETISS at various levels of abstraction interactively. The tool is further demonstrated by identifying
performance bottlenecks in muRiscvNN kernel library.
