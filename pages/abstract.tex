%TODO: Abstract
This study dives into the world of profiling RISC-V architecture with a strong focus on \ac{TinyML} workloads. Performance profiling is a crucial part of developing hardware and software based on RISC-V \ac{ISA}. It helps identifying performance bottlenecks in benchmarks and facilitates the refinement of custom extensions and the improvement of machine learning kernels. However, it remains a significant challenge since most existing open-source profiling tools provide limited support for RISC-V architecture.


In this work, a tool that supports instruction-level profiling on RISC-V architecture is developed. It takes a binary executable and an instruction trace generated from \ac{ETISS}, a RISC-V development
virtual platform developed at the \ac{TUM}, and collect meta-data about the call graph hierarchy. The outputs are kcachegrind-compatible, enabling users to view profiling results in an interactive and fine-grained manner.


The tool is used to benchmark muRISCV-NN, a kernel library also developed at the same chair, providing use cases in real scenarios. It demonstrates how the process of identifying performance bottlenecks can be simplified and sped up.
